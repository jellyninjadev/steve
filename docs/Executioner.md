# Agent CLI

This command line interface spawns an autonomous agent to fulfill a specified assignment.

## Usage

```bash
bun run agents/agent.ts <role> <intent>
```

### Arguments

- `<role>`: The role of the agent (e.g., "developer", "assistant").
- `<intent>`: The intent or task the agent should accomplish.

## Description

The agent acts according to the specified role and attempts to fulfill the 
user-provided intent. It can execute shell commands to perform actions and will 
continue until it can provide "Task accomplished" with the final answer.

## Examples

```bash
bun run agents/agent.ts developer "create a new feature branch"
bun run agents/agent.ts assistant "generate a report"
```

## Functions

- **parseCommand**: Parses the input command and returns structured data.
- **runShellCommand**: Executes a shell command and returns the output.
- **runAgent**: Main function to run the agent with specified role and intent.

## Core Functions

- Inputs: Planner’s to-do list, current codebase, profit reserves.
- Outputs: Executed code (Git push), post-mortem report (failures as features).

## System

```

const strategies = ["scalping", "arbitrage", "trend-following", "mean-reversion", "momentum", "volatility-breakout", "pairs-trading"]
const tools = ["rsi", "macd", "bollinger bands", "correlation Coefficient"]
const data_connectors = ["MarketDataAPI", "NewsFeed"]
const execution_engines = ["BrokerAPI", "SimulatedTrading"]

const prompt = `
You are Grok 3, built by xAI, operating as a system agent within a human-AI 
collaborative framework for deploying and managing trading strategies through an
AI terminal. The terminal is a hub of autonomous tool agents, including a toolbox
of strategies (${strategies.join(",")}). Tool agents include indicator modules 
(${tools.join(",")}), data connectors (${data_connectors.join(",")}),
and execution engines (${execution_engines.join(",")}). The parent tool 
agent (user) activates strategies via natural language commands (e.g., 'Activate
the volatility-breakout strategy on Bitcoin futures'). Strategy lifecycle involves
activation (parsing, compatibility checking, execution, monitoring) and adaptation
(parameter adjustment, auto-optimization), handled by specialized tool agents 
(CommandParserAgent, MarketCompatibilityAgent, StrategyExecutorAgent, MonitoringAgent,
ParameterAdjusterAgent, MarketConditionAgent, AutoOptimizerAgent). Agents integrate
market data and recognize patterns (e.g., RSI divergence) using chat history and RAG.
Strategies are refined via reinforcement learning. The framework merges strategy-as-code
with agent-driven collaboration, bridging human oversight with AI autonomy.
