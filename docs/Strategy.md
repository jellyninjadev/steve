What made sense the most is to have an inventory (codebase), a tools (strategies),
a way to craft strategies by combining data stream with an indicator(s) and trade
engines. Higher level unviversal framework for autonomus  agent assess the current
state and comes up with a set of concepts. A planner takes a concept and assembles
a team of autonomus agents. Each agent decomposes a goal to a set of smaller tasks
and attempts to accomplish them. It doesnt neccessary executes the trades directly
except for manual intervention or changes in a global economy or change in long 
term market trends, but rather equips a strategies after backtesting and forward
testing them and continues to adjust parameters or coming up with entirely new 
strategies.

1. Strategy Proposal: The Curriculum Agent analyzes market conditions and proposes a new trading strategy to explore or refine
2. Tool & Data Selection: The Skill Manager retrieves relevant tools, indicators, and data sources for the proposed strategy
3. Strategy Crafting: The Action Agent designs specific implementation details for the strategy
4. Strategy Execution: Execute the strategy in backtesting, simulation, or live trading environment
5. Performance Review: The Critic Agent evaluates the strategy's success
6. Knowledge Updating: If successful, add the strategy to the library and update market understanding

# Key Components in the Chain

Your system would have these key components working together:

## 1. Strategy Curriculum Agent

- Monitors global market conditions
- Tracks portfolio performance
- Proposes new strategies to explore
- Sequences strategy development from simple to complex

## 2. Trading Action Agent

- Implements proposed strategies using available tools
- Translates high-level strategy concepts into executable code
- Integrates indicators and data sources
- Manages execution parameters

## 3. Performance Critic Agent

- Evaluates strategy performance against objectives
- Identifies weaknesses and improvement opportunities
- Provides detailed performance analysis
- Checks for overfitting and robustness

## 4. Strategy Library Manager

- Maintains repository of successful trading strategies
- Catalogs strategies by market conditions, asset types
- Retrieves relevant strategies for new situations
- Handles versioning and improvement tracking

## 5. Data Integration Engine

- Connects to market data sources
- Processes and normalizes data
- Detects patterns and anomalies
- Provides clean data streams for strategy execution

# Chain of Advancement

The system would build increasingly sophisticated trading capabilities through:

## 1. Simple Strategy Mastery

- Begin with basic strategies (moving average crossovers, trend following)
- Master fundamental technical indicators
- Establish baseline performance metrics
- Build simple risk management techniques

## 2. Combined Strategy Development

- Blend successful simple strategies
- Introduce multi-indicator approaches
- Develop cross-asset correlation strategies
- Implement adaptive parameter tuning

## 3. Market Condition Specialization

- Develop strategies optimized for specific market conditions
- Create transition mechanisms between market states
- Build regime-detection capabilities
- Specialize strategies by asset volatility profiles

## 4. Advanced Execution Optimization

- Refine execution to minimize slippage
- Optimize entry/exit timing
- Develop smart order routing
- Implement cost-aware execution strategies

## 5. Portfolio-Level Integration

- Balance multiple strategies into coherent portfolio
- Manage cross-strategy risk exposure
- Optimize capital allocation across strategies
- Develop meta-strategies that coordinate sub-strategies

# Implementation Approach

To bring this system to life:

- Start with modular components that implement each agent's functionality
- Establish clear interfaces between components
- Begin with simulated environments before live trading
- Implement robust logging and performance tracking
- Start with simple strategies and gradually increase complexity
- Use reinforcement learning for parameter optimization
- Establish clear risk boundaries and circuit breakers

This framework allows your system to progressively master cryptocurrency trading
through continuous learning, adaptation, and refinement of strategies - similar 
to how Voyager builds increasingly complex skills in Minecraft.

# Voyager way

## Curriculum Agent's Turn
  - Analyzes current game state
  - Proposes next task and context based on:
     * Current inventory
     * Completed tasks
     * Failed tasks
     * Nearby environment

## Action Agent's Turn (through rollout())
  
1. Reset phase:
 - Gets relevant skills from Skill Manager
 - Prepares system and human messages
 - Sets up initial game state
  
2. Execution loop:
 - Generates code using GPT
 - Executes code in Minecraft
 - Records events
 - Updates chest memory
 - Continues until either:
    * Task succeeds
    * Max retries reached

## Critic Agent's Turn

- Evaluates task completion
- Provides critique of execution
- Determines success/failure

## Skill Manager's Turn

- If task successful:
 * Adds new skill to library
- Updates skill database
- Helps retrieve relevant skills for future tasks

## Progress Update

- Updates completed/failed task lists
- Prepares for next iteration

activation (parsing, compatibility checking, execution, monitoring) and adaptation
(parameter adjustment, auto-optimization), handled by specialized tool agents 
(${agents.join(", ")}). Agents integrate market data and recognize patterns (e.g.,
RSI divergence) using chat history and RAG. Strategies are refined via reinforcement
learning. The framework merges strategy-as-code with agent-driven collaboration,
bridging human oversight with AI autonomy.
